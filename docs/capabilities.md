# Chuchu Capabilities & Limitations

**Last Updated:** December 2025  
**Current Version:** 0.x (MVP)  
**Overall Autonomy:** 38/64 scenarios (59%)

This document describes what Chuchu can and cannot do autonomously. Updated with each major release.

---

## What Chuchu Can Do

### ✅ GitHub Issue Resolution (100% MVAA)

Chuchu can autonomously resolve simple GitHub issues end-to-end:

- Fetch issue details and parse requirements
- Create feature branch from issue
- Find relevant files using AI-powered discovery
- Implement solution (1-3 file changes)
- Run tests and auto-fix failures
- Run linters and auto-fix issues
- Build and validate code
- Check code coverage
- Scan for security vulnerabilities
- Commit with proper issue reference
- Create pull request with description
- Handle CI failures with auto-fix
- Address PR review comments
- Iterate until approved

**Languages supported:** Go, TypeScript, Python, Elixir, Ruby

**Commands:**
```bash
chu issue fix 123       # Fetch and implement
chu issue commit 123    # Validate and commit  
chu issue push 123      # Create PR
chu issue ci 42         # Handle CI failures
chu issue review 42     # Address review comments
```

**Limitations:**
- Works best for simple bug fixes (1-3 files)
- Complex refactoring not yet supported
- May need human intervention on difficult test failures

---

### ✅ Test Execution & Validation (38%)

Chuchu can run and validate code across multiple languages:

**Test Runners:**
- Go: `go test`
- TypeScript: `npm test`, `yarn test`
- Python: `pytest`
- Elixir: `mix test`
- Ruby: `rspec`

**Linters:**
- Go: `golangci-lint`, `go vet`
- TypeScript: `eslint`, `tsc`
- Python: `mypy`, `ruff`, `black`
- Elixir: `credo`, `dialyzer`, `mix format`
- Ruby: `rubocop`
- General: `prettier`

**Additional Validation:**
- Build checking (`go build`, `npm run build`, `mix compile`)
- Code coverage analysis (Go, Python)
- Security scanning (`govulncheck`, `npm audit`, `safety`)

**Limitations:**
- Cannot generate new tests yet (coming soon)
- Coverage tracking only for Go and Python
- Mock generation not supported

---

### ✅ Error Recovery (80%)

Chuchu can automatically fix common failures:

- Syntax errors and compilation failures
- Test failures (simple cases)
- Linting violations
- CI/CD failures (with log analysis)
- Rollback on critical failures

**How it works:**
1. Detects failure
2. Analyzes error message and context
3. Generates fix using LLM
4. Applies fix and re-runs validation
5. Retries up to 2 times

**Success rate:** ~70% for simple failures

**Limitations:**
- Cannot resolve merge conflicts yet
- Complex business logic failures need human review
- Environmental issues require manual intervention

---

### ✅ Codebase Understanding (60%)

Chuchu can analyze and navigate codebases:

- Find relevant files for an issue (AI-powered)
- Identify test files for a given implementation
- Analyze git history for similar changes
- Provide confidence scores for file suggestions

**Example:**
```
Issue: "Add password validation with special characters"

Chuchu identifies:
1. [HIGH 0.9] auth/validator.go - Main validation logic
2. [MED 0.6] auth/validator_test.go - Needs test updates  
3. [LOW 0.3] config/security.go - May need config
```

**Limitations:**
- Cannot trace complex dependencies yet
- Documentation parsing not implemented
- Convention extraction limited

---

## What Chuchu Cannot Do (Yet)

### ❌ Complex Code Modifications (0/12 scenarios)

The following require human intervention:

- **Multi-file refactoring** - Changing function signatures across 5+ files
- **Database migrations** - Creating migrations and updating models
- **API changes** - Coordinated updates to routes, handlers, tests
- **Breaking changes** - Updating all consumers of changed APIs
- **Type system changes** - Complex type definition updates
- **Performance optimizations** - Profiling and bottleneck identification
- **Security fixes** - Complex vulnerability patches
- **Configuration changes** - Environment-specific configurations
- **Backward compatibility** - Maintaining old APIs while adding new

**Why:** These require deep architectural understanding and multi-step coordination. Coming in future releases.

---

### ❌ Advanced Test Generation (5/8 scenarios missing)

Not yet implemented:

- Generate unit tests for new code
- Generate integration tests
- Identify and fill coverage gaps
- Create mock objects and test doubles
- Snapshot testing

**Why:** Test generation requires understanding of testing patterns, edge cases, and project conventions. High priority for next phase.

**Workaround:** Chuchu can run existing tests and fix failures, so manual test creation + automated fixing is possible.

---

### ❌ Merge Conflicts (1/5 scenarios missing)

Chuchu cannot:

- Automatically resolve merge conflicts with main branch

**Why:** Conflict resolution requires semantic understanding of both changes and intent. Risky to automate without human review.

**Workaround:** Resolve conflicts manually, then use Chuchu to validate the merged code.

---

### ❌ Advanced Git Operations (0/5 scenarios)

Not implemented:

- Interactive rebase (squash, reword)
- Cherry-picking commits
- Git bisect for bug hunting
- Complex 3-way merge conflicts
- Branch rebasing

**Why:** Low priority - these operations are infrequent and risky to automate.

---

### ❌ Documentation Updates (0/3 scenarios)

Chuchu cannot automatically:

- Update README files
- Generate CHANGELOG entries
- Update API documentation

**Why:** Documentation requires understanding of user impact and communication style. Coming soon.

**Workaround:** Use `chu chat` mode to draft documentation, then review and commit manually.

---

## Roadmap

### Next Release (Targeting 80% Autonomy)

**Phase 7: Complex Code Modifications (12 scenarios)**
- Multi-file refactoring
- API changes with coordinated updates
- Database migrations
- Type system improvements

**Phase 8: Test Generation (5 scenarios)**
- Auto-generate unit tests for new code
- Integration test creation
- Mock generation

**Phase 9: Documentation (3 scenarios)**
- README updates
- CHANGELOG generation
- API docs synchronization

---

## How to Check Current Status

Run E2E tests to see what's working:

```bash
# All tests
go test -tags=e2e ./tests/e2e/... -v

# Specific capability
go test -tags=e2e ./tests/e2e/run -run TestGitHubIssueIntegration -v
```

Skipped tests (t.Skip()) represent features not yet implemented.
