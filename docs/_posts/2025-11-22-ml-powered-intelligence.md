# ML-Powered Intelligence: 500x Faster, 92% Cheaper

*November 22, 2025*

Today we're announcing embedded machine learning in GPTCode. Two lightweight ML models now power instant decision-making with zero external dependencies and zero API costs.

**The bigger picture**: Commercial AI copilots charge $20-30/month per user or **$200 per 50K requests** ($4,000/1M requests). GPTCode with Groq costs **~$316/1M requests** (92% cheaper) or **$0 with Ollama**. ML routing is one piece of how we achieve this.

## The Problem with LLM-Only Routing

Every time you interact with an AI coding assistant, there's a hidden cost:

**Intent classification** - deciding whether you want to read code, edit it, or search documentation - requires an LLM call:
- **Latency**: ~500ms per request  
- **Cost**: ~$0.000005 per classification (using llama-3.1-8b-instant)
- **Adds up**: While routing costs are small, they're pure overhead on top of your actual coding work

For simple decisions like "is this a query or an edit?", calling a 70B parameter model is overkill.

## The Solution: Hybrid ML + LLM

GPTCode now embeds two ML models that run locally in pure Go:

### 1. Intent Classifier

Routes user requests to the right agent (query, editor, research, review):

| Metric | ML Classifier | LLM Router |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **Latency** | ~1ms | ~500ms |
| **Cost** | $0 | $0.000005 |
| **Accuracy** | 85-90% | 95%+ |

**Training data**: The model is trained on 1,200+ examples including the NL2Bash corpus[^3], which provides natural language descriptions of shell commands. This enables accurate classification of shell/git command requests like "run git diff and create commit message".

**Smart fallback**: When the ML model is uncertain (confidence < threshold), it falls back to the LLM. You get speed when possible, accuracy when needed.

### 2. Complexity Classifier

Auto-detects if a task is simple or complex:

```bash
chu chat "fix typo in readme"
# → Simple task, stays in chat mode

chu chat "implement oauth2 with jwt"
# → Complex task, automatically activates Guided Mode
```

No more manual mode switching. The system adapts to task complexity automatically.

## Real-World Impact

For **1000 requests per day** (typical heavy usage):

### Without ML (LLM only)
- Latency: 500ms × 1000 = **8.3 minutes of waiting**
- Routing cost: $0.000005 × 1000 = **$0.15/month**

### With ML (80% ML, 20% LLM fallback)
- Latency: (1ms × 800) + (500ms × 200) = **1.7 minutes**
- Routing cost: ($0 × 800) + ($0.000005 × 200) = **$0.03/month**

**Result:**
- **83% faster** (8.3min → 1.7min)
- **80% cheaper routing** ($0.15 → $0.03)
- **Same accuracy** (smart fallback maintains quality)

> **Note**: These are routing overhead costs only. Your actual LLM costs for coding tasks (queries, edits, research) are separate and unchanged.

## How It Works

Both models use the same architecture:

```
User Input
    ↓
TF-IDF Vectorization (1-3 grams)
    ↓
Logistic Regression[^1]
    ↓
Confidence Score
    ↓
High confidence → ML result (1ms)
Low confidence → LLM fallback (500ms)
```

**Model specs:**
- **Size**: 19-66KB (tiny!)
- **Runtime**: Pure Go, zero Python dependencies
- **Training**: scikit-learn, exports to JSON
- **Inference**: <1ms per prediction

## Configuration

Both models have configurable confidence thresholds:

```bash
# Intent classification (default: 0.7)
chu config get defaults.ml_intent_threshold
chu config set defaults.ml_intent_threshold 0.8  # More conservative

# Complexity detection (default: 0.55)
chu config get defaults.ml_complex_threshold
chu config set defaults.ml_complex_threshold 0.6  # Less Guided Mode
```

> **Note**: These use `chu config` commands for direct manipulation. For general backend/profile management, see the user-friendly `chu backend` and `chu profile` commands.

**Lower threshold** = more ML, faster but riskier
**Higher threshold** = more LLM fallback, slower but safer

## CLI Commands

### Test the models interactively

```bash
# Test intent classification
chu ml test intent
> explain this code
Prediction: query (confidence: 0.89)

# Test complexity detection
chu ml test complexity
> implement oauth2 authentication
Prediction: complex (confidence: 0.91) → Would trigger Guided Mode
```

### Evaluate accuracy

```bash
chu ml eval intent
Overall Accuracy: 89.1%

chu ml eval complexity
Overall Accuracy: 92.3%
```

### Train your own models

```bash
# Retrain with your own examples
chu ml train intent
chu ml train complexity
```

Training data is in `ml/{model}/data/training_data.csv` - add your own examples and retrain to customize the models for your workflow.

## Total Cost: GPTCode vs Commercial Copilos

Let's compare **total costs** (routing + actual work) for 1M coding requests:

### Commercial AI Copilots

**GitHub Copilot / Cursor / Others:**
- Typical pricing: **$20-30/month** per user (flat rate)
- Or: **$200 per 50K requests** for API access
- **1M requests = $4,000**

### GPTCode with Groq (Recommended Budget Setup)

**Configuration:**
- Router: llama-3.1-8b-instant (ML handles 80%, LLM 20%)
- Query: gpt-oss-120b (free tier on OpenRouter)
- Editor: llama-3.3-70b-versatile  
- Research: groq/compound (free)

**Cost breakdown for 1M requests:**

```
Routing (20% LLM, 80% ML):
  200K × $0.000005 = $1
  
Query agent (300K requests, ~500 tokens avg):
  150M tokens × $0/M = $0 (free tier)
  
Editor agent (500K requests, ~1000 tokens avg):
  500M tokens:
    Input (400M): $0.59/M = $236
    Output (100M): $0.79/M = $79
  Total: $315
  
Research agent (200K requests):
  Free (groq/compound)
```

**Total: ~$316 for 1M requests** (vs $4,000 commercial)

**Savings: $3,684 (92% cheaper)**

### GPTCode with Ollama (Zero Cost)

**Configuration:**
- All agents: qwen2.5-coder:32b (local)
- Hardware: Needs 32GB RAM (~$500 one-time)

**Cost for 1M requests: $0** (after hardware)

Electricity: ~$5-10/month for 24/7 usage

### The Real Difference

ML routing saves **$5 on routing** per 1M requests, but that's not the story.

The story is:
- **GPTCode with Groq: $316/1M requests** (92% cheaper than commercial)
- **GPTCode with Ollama: $0/1M requests** (100% cheaper)
- **Commercial copilos: $4,000/1M requests**

> ML routing is just one piece. The real savings come from using affordable/free models with multi-agent architecture.

## Routing Cost at Scale

Now let's zoom in on just the routing overhead:

Routing costs scale with usage. For a codebase processing **100M tokens** in actual coding work:

**Typical usage pattern:**
- 100M tokens of actual work (queries, edits, research)
- Estimated ~1.33M user interactions (averaging 75 tokens per request)
- Each interaction needs routing decision (85 tokens: 75 input + 10 output)

**Without ML (LLM routing):**
- 1.33M routing calls × $0.000005 = **$6.65 routing overhead**
- Plus your $100+ in actual LLM work costs
- Total: **$106.65+**

**With ML (80% confidence, 20% LLM fallback):**
- ML calls: 1.06M requests (80%) = **$0**
- LLM fallback: 266k requests (20%) × $0.000005 = **$1.33**
- Plus your $100+ in actual LLM work costs (unchanged)
- Total: **$101.33+**
- **Routing savings: $5.32** (80% reduction on routing overhead)

> **Important**: The $100+ in actual LLM usage for your coding tasks is separate and unchanged. ML only reduces the routing overhead (~5% of total costs).

## Impact on Free Tier Profiles

Many OpenRouter models have rate limits (free tier). ML routing helps you stay under limits:

**Example: Grok 4.1 Fast (free tier)**
- Limit: ~100 requests/minute
- Without ML: Router uses 100 req/min = **hitting limit**
- With ML: Router uses 20 req/min = **80% capacity freed**

This means you can handle 5x more chat interactions before hitting rate limits on free models.

## Why This Matters

**Speed**: Fast routing means the assistant feels instant. No more waiting 500ms just to figure out what you want to do.

**Cost**: Routing happens on every interaction. At scale, ML routing saves real money without sacrificing quality.

**Privacy**: ML models run locally. Your task descriptions never leave your machine for simple routing decisions.

**Offline**: No internet? No problem. ML models work completely offline.

**Customizable**: Don't like the default behavior? Adjust thresholds or retrain with your own data.

## Real Usage Example

```bash
$ chu chat

> show me the auth code
# ML: "show" → query agent (1ms)
# Reads relevant files, explains auth flow

> add rate limiting to login endpoint  
# ML: "add" → editor agent (1ms)
# Opens editor, implements rate limiting

> how do other projects handle rate limiting?
# ML: uncertain (confidence: 0.65 < 0.7)
# Fallback: LLM router → research agent (500ms)
# Searches web, summarizes best practices

> fix the test that's failing
# ML: "fix" + "test" → editor agent (1ms)
# Runs tests, identifies issue, fixes it
```

**Result**: 3 out of 4 requests used ML (1ms), only 1 used LLM (500ms). Total routing time: **503ms** instead of **2000ms**.

## The Hybrid Advantage

Pure ML would be faster but less accurate.
Pure LLM would be more accurate but slower and expensive.

**Hybrid ML + LLM**[^2] gives you the best of both worlds:
- Fast path for confident decisions (80-90% of requests)
- Smart fallback for edge cases
- Configurable balance between speed and accuracy
