# Why GPTCode Isn't Trying to Beat Anyone (And Why That's the Point)

Let me be brutally honest: **GPTCode is not going to beat Cursor's UX**. It won't have Copilot's polish. It probably won't match whatever magical 95% accuracy the next AI coding startup promises.

And you know what? **That's completely fine.**

## The Problem with "Better"

Every AI coding tool today positions itself the same way:
- "10x faster than competitors"
- "99% accuracy" (citation needed)
- "Ship code in minutes, not hours"
- "AI that actually works™"

Then you use them and discover:
- The UX is slick, but it's a black box
- Something breaks, you have no idea why
- The cost is $30/month (forever)
- You're locked into their ecosystem
- When it fails, you're stuck waiting for a fix

## What GPTCode Actually Is

GPTCode is **different**, not "better":

### 1. **Transparent by Default**

When GPTCode's Reviewer marks your code as FAIL even though it succeeded (yes, this happens), you can:
- Read the exact code that's broken (`internal/agents/reviewer.go`)
- Understand WHY it failed (LLM returned bullets as issues)
- Fix it yourself in 30 minutes
- Submit a PR and help everyone

**Cursor fails?** You file a ticket and wait.

### 2. **Hackable to the Core**

Don't like Symphony's movement decomposition? Change it.
Want a different Planner prompt? Edit it.
Need a custom agent? Build one.

```go
// It's just Go code
func (c *Conductor) isQueryTask(plan string, modifiedFiles []string) bool {
    // Your logic here
}
```

**Other tools?** Hope the vendor adds your feature someday.

### 3. **Model Agnostic**

Today you use Groq because it's cheap and fast.
Tomorrow OpenAI releases GPT-5? Switch in 2 minutes.
Want to try DeepSeek R1 locally? Done.

```yaml
backend:
  groq:
    router: llama-3.1-8b-instant
  ollama:
    editor: deepseek-r1:70b
  openai:
    query: gpt-5-turbo  # when it exists
```

**Copilot/Cursor?** You get what they give you.

### 4. **Honest About Limitations**

GPTCode's E2E tests: **5/9 passing (55%)**

Not "95% accuracy". Not "just works". Real numbers. Real problems. Real transparency.

You know exactly what you're getting:
- Query tasks? Work great (after recent fixes)
- Edit tasks? Decent, improving
- Complex refactors? Still learning
- TDD workflows? Pretty solid

## The Real Competition

GPTCode isn't competing with Cursor or Copilot.

GPTCode is competing with:
1. **Vendor lock-in** → You control everything
2. **Black boxes** → Full source, full understanding
3. **$30/month forever** → $2-5/month or $0 local
4. **"Trust us, it works"** → See exactly how it works (and fails)

## Who This Is For

**Use Cursor if:**
- You want polished UX now
- You don't care about vendor lock-in
- $20/month is pocket change
- You just want it to work™

**Use GPTCode if:**
- You want to understand your tools
- You value control over polish
- You're OK fixing bugs yourself (and learning from it)
- You want to contribute to something real
- You refuse to pay $240/year for software you can't inspect

## The Vision

We're not trying to build "the best AI coding tool."

We're building **the most transparent, hackable, and affordable AI coding tool**.

A tool where:
- When it breaks, you can fix it
- When you want a feature, you can build it
- When you disagree with a design, you can change it
- When the LLM landscape shifts, you can adapt instantly

## The Reality Check

Will GPTCode ever have Cursor's sleek UX? Probably not.
Will it match Copilot's marketing budget? Definitely not.
Will it promise 99% accuracy? Nope—we'll tell you it's 55% and show you how to make it 75%.

But will it give you **control**, **transparency**, and **freedom**?

**Absolutely.**

## What We're Building

Here's what we're actually working on:

**This Week (Dec 2025)**:
- ✅ Fixed Reviewer issue extraction (was marking SUCCESS as FAIL)
- ✅ Symphony now collapses redundant query movements
- ✅ Maestro skips validation for read-only tasks
- 📊 E2E: 5/9 passing (was 4/9) → **11% improvement**

**This Month**:
- Improve Symphony movement quality (target: 7/9 passing)
- Add unit test coverage for all helpers
- Better Planner success criteria generation
- Strengthen Reviewer prompts

**This Quarter**:
- Get E2E to 8/9 passing (89%)
- Add telemetry (opt-in, transparent)
- Improve cost tracking per agent
- Documentation overhaul

Notice what's NOT on the list:
- ❌ "Revolutionize AI coding"
- ❌ "10x developer productivity"
- ❌ "95% accuracy guaranteed"

Just honest, incremental improvements you can track in git commits.

## The Invitation

If you want:
- A tool that's **transparent** about what it can and can't do
- A codebase you can **understand and modify**
- A community building something **real**, not hyped
- An AI coding assistant that respects your **time, money, and intelligence**

Then GPTCode is for you.

If you want something that "just works" out of the box with zero configuration and perfect UX?

Honestly, try Cursor first. No hard feelings.

## Get Involved

```bash
# Try it yourself
go install github.com/gptcode-cloud/cli/cmd/gptcode@latest
gptcode setup

# See exactly what's broken
go test ./tests/e2e/...

# Fix something
git clone https://github.com/gptcode-cloud/cli
cd gptcode
# internal/agents/reviewer.go is a good place to start
```

We're not here to beat anyone.

We're here to be **different**. **Transparent**. **Yours**.
