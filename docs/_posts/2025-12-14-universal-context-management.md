## The Problem Nobody's Talking About

You're 3 hours into a new AI assistant session. You've already explained:

- Your microservices architecture (again)
- Which services use which databases (for the 10th time this week)
- The deployment process (because it forgot)
- What you're actually trying to build (starting from scratch)

**Sound familiar?**

Every. Single. Session.

With every AI tool (Warp, Cursor, ChatGPT, Claude), you're playing the same game:

> "Let me copy-paste this architecture doc... wait, where did I put it? Oh right, it's in Notion. No wait, we updated it in Slack. Actually, is this version outdated?"

Meanwhile, your teammate is explaining a *completely different* architecture to their AI assistant.

## The Hidden Cost

Let's do the math:

- **10 minutes** setting up context per session
- **5 AI sessions** per day (switching tools, new features, debugging)
- **50 minutes/day** just explaining your own project
- **~4 hours/week**
- **~200 hours/year** per developer

For a 10-person team, that's **2,000 hours/year** = **$200,000** in wasted time (at $100/hour).

And that's *before* counting:
- Inconsistent answers (each dev has different context)
- Onboarding nightmare (2 weeks for new devs to grok the system)
- Context drift (your AI doesn't know about last month's refactor)
- Tool switching penalty (different context in Warp vs Cursor vs Claude)

## The Solution: Treat Context Like Code

Here's a radical idea: **What if project context was version-controlled, team-shared, and tool-agnostic?**

Just like you wouldn't copy-paste code between developers, why copy-paste context between AI sessions?

### Introducing Universal Context Management

```bash
# One time setup
cd ~/your-project
gptcode context init

# Edit context (like editing code)
vi .gptcode/context/shared.md

# Sync to ALL your AI tools
gptcode context sync
# ✅ Warp
# ✅ Cursor
# ✅ Clipboard (for ChatGPT/Claude web)
```

That's it. **Single source of truth.** Version-controlled. Team-shared.

### What You Get

**1. Zero-effort context loading**

```bash
# Every Warp session
gptcode context sync  # ← 1 second
# vs
# 10 minutes of copy-pasting and explaining
```

**2. Team consistency**

```bash
# Developer A updates architecture
echo "## Redis Layer\nCaching strategy..." >> .gptcode/context/shared.md
git commit -am "Add Redis context"
git push

# Developer B gets it automatically
git pull
gptcode context sync
# ✅ Their AI now knows about Redis too
```

**3. Tool agnosticism**

Same context works in:
- ✅ Warp Terminal
- ✅ Cursor IDE
- ✅ ChatGPT web (via clipboard)
- ✅ Claude web (via clipboard)
- ✅ Any AI assistant (via clipboard)

**4. Context evolution**

```bash
git log .gptcode/context/shared.md

commit abc123 - "Add Redis caching layer"
commit def456 - "Migrate to microservices"  
commit ghi789 - "Initial monolith architecture"
```

Your AI's knowledge evolves with your codebase. Because it's *in* your codebase.

## Real-World Example

### Before: Chaos

**Monday morning, Developer A:**
```
AI: What's your architecture?
Dev: We have a monolith with PostgreSQL...
[10 minutes of explanation]
```

**Monday afternoon, Developer B:**
```
AI: What's your architecture?  
Dev: We're migrating to microservices...
[15 minutes of different explanation]
```

**Tuesday, new feature:**
```
AI: What's your architecture?
Dev: Ugh, let me start over...
```

### After: One Source of Truth

**`.gptcode/context/shared.md` (committed to git):**
```markdown
# Architecture

Currently transitioning from monolith to microservices:
- **Monolith** (legacy): Rails app, PostgreSQL
- **Services** (new): 
  - API Gateway (Kong)
  - User Service (Elixir)
  - Payment Service (Node.js)

## Communication
- Services use Redis pub/sub
- Monolith gradually being decomposed

## What to work on
See .gptcode/context/next.md
```

**Every developer, every session:**
```bash
gptcode context sync  # ← Done
```

AI knows:
- Current architecture (monolith + microservices)
- Communication patterns (Redis pub/sub)
- Where to find next tasks

**Consistent. Always up-to-date. Zero effort.**

## The Three Context Files

### `shared.md` - The Technical Foundation
Stable, changes slowly (monthly):
- Architecture
- Tech stack
- Patterns & conventions
- Development setup

### `next.md` - Current Priorities
Changes frequently (weekly):
- What we're building now
- This sprint's focus
- Immediate blockers

### `roadmap.md` - The Vision
Changes occasionally (quarterly):
- Q1/Q2/Q3 goals
- Future direction
- Long-term plans

**Why separate?**
- AI doesn't need your Q3 roadmap when fixing a bug
- "What's next?" and "How does this work?" are different questions
- Smaller context = faster AI responses, lower costs

## How It Works

### 1. Single Source of Truth

```
.gptcode/context/   ← Edit here (ONE place)
  shared.md
  next.md
  roadmap.md
```

### 2. Auto-Sync to Integrations

```bash
gptcode context sync

# Writes:
WARP.md              ← Warp reads this
.cursor/docs/        ← Cursor reads this
```

### 3. Version-Controlled Evolution

```bash
git log .gptcode/

commit def456 - "Update: Redis caching added"
commit abc123 - "Update: migrated to microservices"
```

### 4. Team Shares via Git

```bash
git pull              # Get team's context updates
gptcode context sync  # Update local tools
```

## Use Cases

### Large Monorepos

**20+ microservices, different patterns per service.**

```bash
.gptcode/context/shared.md:
## Services
- user-service: Elixir/Phoenix, port 4000
- payment-service: Node.js, port 3000
- notification-service: Go, port 8080
[... 17 more services]

gptcode context sync  # AI knows ALL services
```

Every session starts with full context. No more "wait, which port does user-service run on?"

### Team Onboarding

**New developer, day 1:**

```bash
git clone repo
cd repo
gptcode context show  # ← Full architecture overview in 30 seconds

gptcode context sync  # ← All AI tools have context
# Start coding immediately
```

No more 2-week ramp-up. Context is in the repo.

### Multi-Tool Workflows

**Terminal (Warp) + IDE (Cursor) + Design (Claude web):**

```bash
# Once
gptcode context sync              # Warp + Cursor

# Per session
gptcode context export clipboard  # Claude web
```

Same context, every tool. Zero copy-paste.

### Context Drift Prevention

**Architecture changed 3 months ago. Your AI still thinks it's a monolith.**

**Solution:**
```bash
# When you refactor
vi .gptcode/context/shared.md  # Update architecture
git commit -am "Update: split into microservices"

# Everyone gets it
git pull
gptcode context sync
```

Context stays synchronized with reality.

## Best Practices

### 1. Update Context with Code

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add Redis caching

Code:
- Added Redis client
- Implemented cache-aside pattern

Context:
- Updated .gptcode/context/shared.md with caching strategy
- Removed 'add caching' from .gptcode/context/next.md
"
```

Context is documentation. It evolves with code.

### 2. Review Context in PRs

```markdown
## PR: Add Redis Caching

### Code Changes
- `lib/redis.ex`: Redis client
- `lib/cache.ex`: Cache implementation

### Context Changes
- `shared.md`: Added "Redis Caching" section
- `next.md`: Removed "Implement caching" task

### Reviewers
Please verify context is accurate ✓
```

### 3. Keep It Focused

**Good:**
```markdown
## Stack
- Backend: Elixir/Phoenix
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- DB: PostgreSQL
```

**Bad:**
```markdown
## Stack
In 2019, we evaluated Ruby vs Elixir vs Node.js. After
considering various factors including performance, developer
experience, ecosystem maturity, hiring pool, and long-term
maintainability, we decided on Elixir because...

Quick reference, not a novel.

## Getting Started

### Install

```bash
# GPTCode CLI includes context management
go install github.com/gptcode-cloud/cli/cmd/gptcode@latest
```

### Initialize

```bash
cd ~/your-project
gptcode context init
```

### Fill in Context

```bash
vi .gptcode/context/shared.md
vi .gptcode/context/next.md
```

### Sync

```bash
gptcode context sync
```

### Commit

```bash
git add .gptcode/ WARP.md
git commit -m "Add project context"
git push
```

**That's it.** Your team now shares context.

## FAQ

### "Isn't this just documentation?"

**Yes, but version-controlled, AI-formatted, auto-synced documentation.**

Traditional docs:
- ❌ Outdated (written once, forgotten)
- ❌ Not AI-friendly (pages of prose)
- ❌ Tool-specific (Notion, Confluence, Google Docs)
- ❌ Separate from code

Context Layer:
- ✅ Lives with code (`.gptcode/` in your repo)
- ✅ Version-controlled (git tracks changes)
- ✅ Concise & structured (AI-optimized format)
- ✅ Universal (works with ANY AI tool)

### "Can't I just use WARP.md?"

You can. But:

- ❌ **Warp-only**: Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT don't read `WARP.md`
- ❌ **No separation**: Mix "what to do next" with "how things work"
- ❌ **No tooling**: Manual editing, no sync, no structure

Context Layer:
- ✅ **Universal**: One source → all tools
- ✅ **Separated**: `shared.md`, `next.md`, `roadmap.md`
- ✅ **Tooling**: `gptcode context sync`, validation, etc.

Think of it as: **WARP.md is the compilation target, `.gptcode/context/` is the source code.**

### "My team doesn't use AI assistants"

**They will.**

In 2023, "nobody used AI for coding."  
In 2024, Cursor raised $100M, Warp added AI agents.  
In 2025, every IDE has AI built-in.

Setting up context now means:
- ✅ Team is ready when they adopt AI
- ✅ Onboarding gets easier (context is there)
- ✅ Better documentation (side benefit)

### "What about private/sensitive information?"

**Everything is local.** No data sent to GPTCode servers.

Context lives in:
- `.gptcode/` in your repo (you control it)
- Synced to local files (`WARP.md`, `.cursor/docs/`)
- Exported to clipboard (you paste it)

For sensitive projects:
- Add `.gptcode/` to `.gitignore` (keep context local-only)
- Or commit public context, keep secrets in separate docs

## The Bottom Line

**Time is your most valuable asset.**

Every minute spent re-explaining your architecture is a minute not spent building.

Universal Context Management gives you:
- **200 hours/year** back (per developer)
- **Consistent** AI responses (team-wide)
- **Instant** onboarding (new devs/AI tools)
- **Evolutionary** documentation (changes with code)

All for running:
```bash
gptcode context init
```

## Try It

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/gptcode-cloud/cli/cmd/gptcode@latest

# Initialize
cd ~/your-project
gptcode context init

# Fill in context
vi .gptcode/context/shared.md

# Sync
gptcode context sync

# Done
```

**5 minutes to set up.**  
**200 hours/year saved.**

**Not a bad ROI.**
