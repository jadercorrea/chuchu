# Plans Directory

This directory contains **planning documents** for future features and improvements.

## Priority System

Plans are prefixed with numbers indicating implementation priority:

- **01-** Highest priority (critical, affects all users)
- **02-** Very high priority (major value/differentiation)
- **03-** High priority (important but can be deferred)
- **04-** Medium priority (nice to have)
- **05-** Low priority (future consideration)

### Current Plans (by priority)

1. **01-user-friendly-commands-and-docs.md** - CLI UX improvements (many tasks already done ✅)
2. **02-autonomous-execution-unified.md** - Programmatic tool calling pattern
3. **03-observer-architecture.md** - CLI telemetry/tracing (🌐 marketing complete, ❌ CLI not implemented)
4. **04-chuchu-observatory-visualization.md** - Real-time dashboard (depends on #3)
5. **05-universal-feedback-collector.md** - Cross-tool feedback capture (Warp AI, Gemini, Claude)

### Special Documents

- **E2E_ROADMAP.md** - Test infrastructure roadmap (active)

## Lifecycle

1. **Create plan** for major features
2. **Number by priority** (01-, 02-, etc.)
3. **Iterate** during implementation
4. **Delete or archive** after completion

## Priority Rationale

Priority is determined by:
- **User impact**: How many users benefit?
- **Value**: How much does it improve the product?
- **Differentiation**: Does it set us apart?
- **ROI**: Implementation cost vs benefit
- **Dependencies**: What blocks other work?

## Notes

- Implemented features should be **deleted**, not archived
- Plans evolve - update priority numbers as context changes
- Check implementation status before assuming something isn't done
